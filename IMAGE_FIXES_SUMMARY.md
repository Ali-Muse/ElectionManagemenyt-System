# Candidate Image Display Fixes - Summary

## Problem
When admin uploads images of candidates, they were not appearing properly across the application due to inconsistent image handling, missing file validation, and lack of proper fallback mechanisms.

## Solution Overview
Created a comprehensive image utility system and updated all files that display candidate images to use consistent, reliable image handling functions.

## Files Created

### 1. `/includes/image_utils.php`
**New utility file containing:**
- `getCandidateImageUrl()` - Get image URL with fallback to placeholder
- `validateImageUpload()` - Validate uploaded image files
- `generateImageFilename()` - Generate unique filenames
- `handleImageUpload()` - Complete image upload handling
- `deleteImageFile()` - Safe image file deletion
- `getCandidateImageHtml()` - Generate HTML img tags with error handling

### 2. `/admin/test_images.php`
**New test page to verify image functionality:**
- Tests image display at different sizes
- Shows file existence status
- Displays upload directory information
- Helps debug image issues

## Files Updated

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistent Image Handling
- All files now use the same utility functions
- Consistent fallback to placeholder images
- Proper error handling with `onerror` attributes

### 2. Better File Validation
- File type validation (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- File size limits (5MB default)
- Security checks to verify actual image files
- Proper MIME type validation

### 3. Improved Upload Process
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Automatic directory creation with proper permissions
- Transaction-safe uploads
- Better error messages

### 4. Enhanced Display Features
- Automatic fallback to placeholder images
- Consistent CSS classes across all displays
- Proper alt text for accessibility
- Error handling for missing images

### 5. Path Handling
- Handles different directory contexts
- Works from admin, voter, candidate, and public directories
- Proper file existence checking
- Web-safe URL generation

## Testing
- Created test page at `/admin/test_images.php`
- Tests image display at multiple sizes
- Verifies file existence and permissions
- Shows upload directory status

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: Images now display consistently across all pages
2. **Security**: Proper file validation prevents malicious uploads
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized image handling makes updates easier
4. **User Experience**: Graceful fallbacks when images are missing
5. **Performance**: Efficient file handling and caching-friendly URLs

## Usage
All candidate images are now handled automatically. When displaying candidate images, the system will:
1. Check if the image file exists
2. Display the actual image if found
3. Fall back to a placeholder if missing
4. Handle errors gracefully with JavaScript fallbacks

The image utility functions can be used throughout the application for consistent image handling.
